# Base Project

This is a base project with both frontend and backend setup.

## Getting Started

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

### Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

The backend uses Express.js and the frontend uses React. Both are written in TypeScript for type safety.
